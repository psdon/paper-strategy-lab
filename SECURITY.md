# Security Policy

This project is primarily a research codebase and comes with **no security guarantees**.

## Reporting a vulnerability

- If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please **do not** open a public issue with details.
- Prefer using **GitHub Security Advisories** (private) for the repository.
- If that’s not available, open a minimal issue and ask a maintainer to enable a private reporting path.

## Scope

- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Unsafe file handling in CLI tools
- Accidental secret/data exposure in repo artifacts
